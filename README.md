# Phishing-Campaign

## Objective
This phishing campaign aims to simulate real-world email attacks to raise awareness and improve employees ability to recognise phishing attempts. The campaign involves sending carefully crafted emails that mimic common threats, such as fake login requests/suspicious attachments. 

By tracking user interactions, we can measure vulnerability, provide targeted training, and reduce the risk of future incidents. The goal is to educate staff on identifying and reporting phishing emails, ultimately strengthening our organisation cybersecurity defenses.

### Skills Learned
**Email Crafting and Social Engineering**: Learning how to design convincing phishing emails that mimic real-world threats, using social engineering techniques to test user awareness.

**Threat Analysis**: Understanding common phishing tactics, such as fake links, attachments, or impersonation, and identifying how attackers exploit human vulnerabilities.

Security Awareness: Gaining insight into employee behaviors and how users respond to threats, helping to tailor future security training.

Metrics and Reporting: Measuring campaign results by tracking metrics like click rates and user responses, and generating reports to highlight vulnerabilities.

Incident Response Planning: Enhancing skills in preparing for actual phishing attacks by simulating how the organization should respond, including user reporting and threat mitigation.

Compliance and Policy Enforcement: Ensuring the campaign aligns with company policies and regulatory standards while fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
